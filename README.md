The following code smaples are taken from four projects I participated in over the few years. Samples are taken from full time, freelance and personal projects, as such the files on the whole are representitive of my work, but not necessarily authored exclusively by me.

2. _app.core.js_ - Sample application core module that defines global methods and kickstarts the application.

3. _carousel.js_ - Module implementing a modified AMD pattern for definition. Uses the Module pattern to define a public facade that can access private and static methods & properties.

4. _node.bootstrap.js_ - A bootstrap module to initialize a Node application using a simple MVC style architecture

5. search.core.js_ - The base object for a Google Custom Search interface object. Additional modules handle applying various query params, submitting the actual query and parsing results.

6. _shower.js_ - An in-progress rewrite of 3rd party module. Used the AMD pattern in conjunction with RequireJS for dependency management. Defines a prototypal object that can be inherited as needed.

## CSS
